# If you want to run Pure-FTPd with this configuration   
# instead of command-line options, please run the
# following command :
#
# /usr/local/sbin/pure-config.pl /usr/local/etc/pure-ftpd.conf
#
# Please don't forget to have a look at documentation at
# http://www.pureftpd.org/documentation.shtml for a complete list of
# options.

# Cage in every user in his home directory

ChrootEveryone              yes



# If the previous option is set to "no", members of the following group
# won't be caged. Others will be. If you don't want chroot()ing anyone,
# just comment out ChrootEveryone and TrustedGID.

# Be 'customer proof' : workaround against common customer mistakes like
# 'chmod 0 public_html', that are valid, but that could cause ignorant
# customers to lock their files, and then keep your technical support busy

# knowledge, this feature is useless. If you're a hosting service, enable it.

# Per-user concurrency limits. It will only work if the FTP server has
# been compiled with --with-peruserlimits (and this is the case on

# When a file is uploaded and there is already a previous version of the file
# with the same name, the old file will neither get removed nor truncated.
# Upload will take place in a temporary file and once the upload is complete,
# the switch to the new version will be atomic. For instance, when a large PHP
# script is being uploaded, the web server will still serve the old version and
# immediatly switch to the new one as soon as the full file will have been
# transfered. This option is incompatible with virtual quotas.

# NoTruncate               yes



# This option can accept three values :

# Do _not_ uncomment this blindly. Be sure that :
# 1) Your server has been compiled with SSL/TLS support (--with-tls),
# 2) A valid certificate is in place,
# 3) Only compatible clients will log in.
